# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

#1 List all of the artist names and track names in alphabetical order

SELECT 
artist_name
, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY artist_name asc;

#2 What are the 3 longest songs?

SELECT 
track_name
, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms 
LIMIT 3;

#3 What are the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT track_name
, artist_name
, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER by popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#4 Which of Olivia Rodrigo's tracks has the highest energy?

SELECT 
track_name
, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'
ORDER BY energy desc;

# 5 What are the 10 least popular songs?

SELECT 
track_name
, artist_name
, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER by popularity asc
LIMIT 10;

# 6 Which artists appear on Spotify's Top 50 at least 3 times?

SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;

# 7 What is the average popularity, length, and danceability by artist and track?

SELECT 
artist_name
, track_name
, AVG(popularity) 
 , AVG(duration_ms) 
, AVG(danceability) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;


# 8 What is the most popular artist?

SELECT 
 artist_name
 , MAX(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
LIMIT 1; 

# 9 What is [Doja Cat's] most popular song on "Spotify's top 50?"

SELECT 
track_name
, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Doja Cat'
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 1;

# 10 How many times did [The Weeknd] appear on "Spotify's Top 50"? 

SELECT  
COUNT(track_name) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'The Weeknd';
